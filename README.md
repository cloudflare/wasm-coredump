# Wasm Coredump Service

Read about [Wasm core dumps and debugging Rust in Cloudflare Workers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/wasm-coredumps/) in our blog to know more.

## Usage

The JS library `@cloudflare/wasm-coredump` is used to send Coredump to the Wasm
Coredump Service.
Install the library:

```
yarn add `@cloudflare/wasm-coredump`
```

Change your Worker's entrypoint to catch crashes and extract a coredump (if any):

`./src/entry.mjs`:
```js
import shim, { getMemory, wasmModule } from "../build/worker/shim.mjs"

async function fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    try {
        return shim.fetch(request, env, ctx);
    } catch (err) {
      const memory = getMemory();
      const coredumpService = env.COREDUMP_SERVICE;
      await recordCoredump({ memory, wasmModule, request, coredumpService });
      throw err;
    }
}

export default { fetch };
```

Point wrangler to the new Worker entrypoint:

`wrangler.toml`:
```
...
main = "src/entry.mjs"
...
```

Make sure wasm-coredump-rewriter is installed

```
cargo install wasm-coredump-rewriter
```

Modify the wrangler.toml build command to add core dump support:
```toml
[build]
command = "cargo install worker-build && COREDUMP=1 worker-build --dev"
```

Now, when a Worker (using the Wasm Coredump Service) crashes you should see in the
logs:

```

```

Additionally you can configure the Wasm Coredump Service to report the exception
in Sentry and/or store the coredump file in R2.


## Sending errors to Sentry

Add to the `wrangler.toml`:

```
...
[vars]
SENTRY_HOST = "..."
SENTRY_PROJECT_ID = "..."
SENTRY_API_KEY = "..."
SENTRY_CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID = "..."
SENTRY_CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET = "..."
```

## Store coredumps in R2

Add to the `wrangler.toml`:

```
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = 'STORAGE'
bucket_name = '...'
```

Note that the binding name has to be set to `STORAGE`.
